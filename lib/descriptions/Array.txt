Arrays are ordered and integer-indexed collections
of objects. The indexes of Arrays are 0 based, meaning
that they start at 0. Negative indexes count back from
the last elements in the collection. -1 indicates the
last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on. An item
is retrieved from the collection using bracket notation ([]).

Example:
arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr[0]    #=> 1
