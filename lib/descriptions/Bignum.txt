Bignum objects hold integers outside the range of
Fixnum. Bignum objects are created automatically
when integer calculations would otherwise overflow
a Fixnum. When a calculation involving Bignum objects
returns a result that will fit in a Fixnum, the
result is automatically converted. Bignum parameter
passing works with references to the object. This is
different from the Fixnum class, where the object
itself is passed.
