Classes in Ruby are first-class objects and each
is an instance of class Class. Each class is also
a global constant and can be used in any part of a
program. Class names are capitalized to differentiate
themselves and to show that they are constants.
Creating new classes is simple and fundamental to
object oriented programming using Ruby.

Example:
class Name
  def initialize
    print "Creating a new instance of #{self.name}"
  end
end

Name.new     #=> "Creating a new instance of Name"
