Fixnum objects hold Integer values. If any integer
exceeds the Fixnum maximum value on your machine,
it will be converted to a Bignum. Fixnum objects
have immediate value. This means that when they are
assigned or passed as parameters, the actual object
is passed, rather than a reference to that object.
Fixnum objects are also immutable, meaning that the
value assigned to that object id will not change no
matter what methods or operations executed. Methods
such as '+' or '-' return a new Fixnum and do not
affect the original value.

As a sidenote: any mathematical operations the involve
two Integers will return an Integer. Meaning that any
decimals that would normally be left over will be rounded.
