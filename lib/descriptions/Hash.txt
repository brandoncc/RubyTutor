Hash objects are similar to Arrays in that they are
a collection. However, Hashes are more similar to
dictionaries in that they have keys, or terms, that
relate to their values, or definitions. Any object can
be used as a key, including other hashes. Hashes are
known as associative arrays and use bracket notation
to retrieve elements. Unlike Arrays, Hashes use the keys
to retrieve the values.

Example:
hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
hash[:a]    #=> 1
