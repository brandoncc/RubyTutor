Proc objects are blocks of code that have been
bound to a set of local variables. Once bound,
the code may be called in different contexts and
still access those variables. Procs can be used
like variables themselves and passed to functions
as arguments. In order to execute the Proc, the
'call' method should be used.

Example:
square = Proc.new {|n| n**2}

def exec_proc(block, num)
  block.call(num)
end

exec_proc(square), 6)    #=> 36
