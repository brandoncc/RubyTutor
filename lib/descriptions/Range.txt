A Range object represents an intervalâ€”a set of
values with a beginning and an end. Ranges may
be constructed using the s..e and s...e literals.
Ranges constructed using .. run from the beginning to
the end inclusively. Those created using ... exclude
the end value. When used as an iterator, ranges return
each value in the sequence. Range objects are used
often in case statements, where the cover? Range
method is used to determine is the case value is
included in the range.

Examples:
array = (1...5).to_a
array[0..-1] => [1, 2, 3, 4]
