A Regexp holds a regular expression, used to match
a pattern against strings. Regexps are created using
the /.../ literals, and by the Regexp::new
constructor. Regular expressions (regexps) are patterns
which describe the contents of a string. Theyâ€™re used
for testing whether a string contains a given pattern,
or extracting the portions that string. They are
created with the /pat/ literals or the
Regexp.new constructor. If a string contains the
pattern, it is said to 'match'. A literal string
matches itself.

Examples:
/hay/ =~ 'haystack'        #=> 0
/y/.match('haystack')      #=> #<MatchData "y">
/needle/.match('haystack') #=> nil
/hay/.match('haystack')    #=> #<MatchData "hay">
