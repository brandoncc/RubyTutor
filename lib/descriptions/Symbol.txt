Symbol objects represent names inside the Ruby
interpreter. They are generated using the :name
literal syntax, and by the various to_sym methods.
While :'string' is also an acceptable form of a
symbol, this syntax is rarely used and generally
frowned upon. Symbols are also known as immutable,
meaning that a symbol cannot be changed when it is
created, only replaced. This makes Symbols ideal as
keys in Hashes.
